// Count the Days

// The elves are SPENT.
// They need some motivation.
// They are (literally) counting down the days until Christmas.

// side note on performance bonuses..
// Santa promised that this year they'd get a bonus on the 26th (as well as an extra 2 PAID days off over the course of the next year!).
// Santa actually promised this last year (and the year before) but no one got a bonus because (according to Santa) "global warming has caused rising sea levels which in turn has eaten coastline, causing a need for many repairs at some of the high-density apartment complexes Santa owns in Florida, resulting in lower cashflow for the parent organization".
// That's what he said, anyway.

// So, as a small token of our appreciation, let's help the elves by implementing a type, DayCounter, that they can use to keep track of how many days are remaining before Christmas.

// The first argument is the beginning of the count (inclusive), and the second argument is the last number to count to (also inclusive).
// It should return a union of numbers representing the remaining days.

// Tests
