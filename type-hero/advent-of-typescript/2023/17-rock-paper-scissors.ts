// Rock, Paper, Scissors

// It's Sunday and there's one week to go before the big day (Christmas Eve) when the elfs' work for the year will finally be complete.
// For the last 20 years the only game the elves have had to play together is StarCraft.
// They're looking for a fresh game to play.

// So, they get the idea to try a Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament.

// But the elves are sorta nerdy so they want to accomplish this using TypeScript types.
// The WhoWins should type to correctly determine the winner in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
// The first argument is the opponent and the second argument is you!

// What's Rock, Paper, Scissors?
// In case you haven't played it before, basically:
// - it's a two player game where each player picks one of three options: Rock (👊🏻), Paper (🖐🏾), and Scissors (✌🏽)
// - game rules:
//   - Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
//   - Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
//   - Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
//   - otherwise, a draw

// Tests
