// Find Santa

// Strange as it may sound..
// Santa went to college with someone that works at a big silicon valley networking company.
// They've been buddies for years.
// So much so that in 2023 Santa pushed the workshop's board until they approved budget to get WiFi on the entire campus.
// That way Santa can browse TikTok as he walks from building to building across the campus.

// But after all that doomscrolling, Santa realized he has lost himself in a Christmas tree forest!
// A search team of elves has been deployed to find him, but he needs to give them more information about where he is among the trees.

// FindSanta is a type that takes a tuple as its only argument and returns the index where Santa is located.
// Let's help Santa get back to the thing he's best at: inspiring leadership.

// note: never is returned if Santa cannot be found among the trees

// Tests
import { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

type Forest0 = ["🎅🏼", "🎄", "🎄", "🎄"];
type test_0_actual = FindSanta<Forest0>;
//   ^?
type test_0_expected = 0;

//   ^?
type test_1_expected = 1;

type test_2_actual = FindSanta<Forest2>;
//   ^?

type Forest3 = ["🎄", "🎄", "🎄", "🎅🏼", "🎄"];
type test_3_actual = FindSanta<Forest3>;
//   ^?
type test_3_expected = 3;

type test_4_actual = FindSanta<Forest4>;
//   ^?
type test_4_expected = never;
type test_4 = Expect<Equal<test_4_expected, test_4_actual>>;

// Answer
export type FindSanta<Forest extends unknown[], Acc extends unknown[] = []> = Forest extends [
  infer First,
  ...infer Rest
]
  ? First extends "🎅🏼"
    ? Acc["length"]
    : FindSanta<Rest, [...Acc, First]>
  : never;
